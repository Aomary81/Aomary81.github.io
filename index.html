      in the ocean I enjoy it. The <strong>tranquility</strong> of being outside

      We used a drone to fly our bait out past the breakers. We put a lip on one
      of the landing gears of the drone to hold the fishing line. Once we got
      where we wanted, I stopped the line, and to release it we turned the drone
      around and continued forward and it slid off the end.
